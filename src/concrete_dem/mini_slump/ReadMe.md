# Mini Slump Test Simulation

*Database of inputs for calibration and validation of fresh concrete model.*

- for ProjectChrono 8.0
- *demo_Slump_SMC_mini_FreeCad* is the input file. 
- Main code for fresh concrete force model is *mycontact_V2_2_floc*.
- Auxiliary files must be in the same folder with the main code file.
- *DFCgeo000-data-particles-mini-2x4-dist* is the file for particles information created by FreeCad.
- *minislump-Cut4.obj* is for the slump cone geometry.
